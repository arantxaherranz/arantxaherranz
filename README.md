- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arantxaherranz
- I'm Spanish journalist focused on technology and innovation
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data journalism and data visualization
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things in this area. It's intensive, but very interesting
- As I saw, data visualization and data storytelling is the next chapter of data analysis, so here we are!
